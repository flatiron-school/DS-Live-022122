GitHub has an API for creating new repositories. Many services have APIs allowing computers to automate tasks that a person might otherwise have to do through a website - whether uploading a photo to Flickr, searching for a company name in a state database, or getting a list of garbage collection times for a municipality."

    "* **Scope** - Just because a company has an API and has information, it doesn't mean you can get all of the information you might want through their API\n",

    "* **Scale** - Some APIs are provided for free as a public service. Others you have to pay for, or allow you to perform activities (like sending a text message) that you pay for. Make sure that you know what the rate limits are and that your use case isn't going to need more API calls than you will be able to make.\n",
